The scripts is written in python which is used for statistical analysis needed for academic research with a sample data.

## Modules required to run the code ##

researchpy is available via pip and through conda for installation

       *) To install using pip,     use: pip install researchpy
       
       *) To install using conda,   use: conda install -c researchpy researchpy
       
Similarly, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn and numpy can be installed

## To run: 
1. Download all of the python scripts in the repository along with sample data files into a single repository. 

2. Run the codes in the script in python (otters.py) or in Jupyter notebook (otters.ipynb)

3. Analysis of 2 variables 

      a) The beginning of the script deals with studying 2 variables at a single time and the influence of 1 on the other. An independent t test and visualizing the data graphically was done using tools like researchpy and seaborn respectively. 
      
      b) rp.ttest performs independent t test. It returns the summary statistical information and the statistical test information. 
      
      c) Seaborn has various functions like .relplot, .catplot which is a great tool for visualizing our results graphically.
      
4. Principal component analysis for multiple variables

   While knn model of PCA is a great tool for generating a algorithm which can predict a certain dependent variable by analyzing the variation in multiple independent variables,   whereas PCA module in sklearn can be used as a statistical analysis tool for understanding the source of various irrespective of type of variable. It also gives the importance of each variable for a specific principal component
   
5. If using a different dataset, edit the filename and necessary variable names in the code.
